# Your To-Do List 🗂️
***This isn't overloaded with heavy navbars, logos, or headers. Just a focused task interface that gives you clarity — nothing more, nothing less. That will truly remind you the importance of the task.***

A clean, no-fluff to-do list web app built from scratch using **vanilla JavaScript** and **traditional CSS**.  
Made for myself — the kind of simple tool I wanted to actually use daily.
